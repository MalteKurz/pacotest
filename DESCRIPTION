Description: Routines for two different test types, the Equal Correlation (ECORR) test and the Vectorial Independence (VI) test are provided. The tests can be applied to check whether a conditional copula coincides with its partial copula. Functions to test whether a regular vine copula satisfies the so-called simplifying assumption or to test a single copula within a regular vine copula to be a (j-1)-th order partial copula are available. The ECORR test comes with a decision tree approach to allow testing in high-dimensional settings.
