## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. The following adaptations have been done

* Revised the Description field in the DESCRIPTION file.
* The missing registration of native routines is a known Rcpp issue (https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/636) which applies to all packages relying on autogenerated files by `Rcpp::compileAttributes`. The problem was fixed by applying the `register` function from the `sourcetools` package as suggested in https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/636. The resulting file `src/pacotest_init.c` is now part of the builded package.
* The NOTE `following (possibly) invalid URLs: URL: https://codecov.io/github/MalteKurz/pacotest?branch=master` was caused by codecov's Wep App which has current status "Major Outage" according to http://status.codecov.io/ which results in timeouts and therefore resulted in the `503: Service Unavailable` note. Not being able to influence codecov's availability, I removed the codecov icon from the README.

## Test environments

* local ubuntu 14.04 install: R 3.3.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci): R-release (R 3.3.2), R-devel (2017-02-15)
